# Nexus

A multimedia relay server (SFU) facilitating video conference calls with a simple browser front-end.

## Usage

Clone this repo and change the working directory to `apps/nexus`.

Fetch dependencies and run the app:

```shell
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
If you join from another tab/browser on the same device, you should see two streams.

## Running with Docker

You can also run Nexus using Docker.

Build an image (or use `ghcr.io/elixir-webrtc/apps/nexus:latest`):

```
docker build -t nexus .
```

and run:

```
docker run \
    -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="secert" \
    -e PHX_HOST=localhost \
    -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
    -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
    --network host \
    nexus
```

Note that secret has to be at least 64 bytes long.
You can generate one with `mix phx.gen.secret`.

If you are running on MacOS, instead of using `--network host` option, you have to explicitly publish ports:

```
docker run \
    -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="secert" \
    -e PHX_HOST=localhost \
    -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
    -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
    -p 4000:4000 \
    -p 50000-50010/udp \
    nexus
```

## Caveats

Seeing as access to video and audio devices requires the browser to be
in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts),
if you want to connect from another device on your network, you have to set up HTTPS access to the server.
Refer to the comments in `config/dev.exs` for more info.

At the moment, there is no way to choose the devices to be used or join without sharing media.
